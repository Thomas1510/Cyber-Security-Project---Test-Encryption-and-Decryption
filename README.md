This project, completed during my internship at Slash Mark Company, focuses on testing various encryption and decryption techniques to ensure secure data handling. As part of my role, I explored different cryptographic algorithms, implemented encryption and decryption processes, and evaluated their effectiveness in protecting sensitive information. This repository contains the code and documentation for the encryption and decryption methods tested, along with analysis and results.
